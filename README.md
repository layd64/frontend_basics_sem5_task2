## Frontend Basics - Task 2
# Burakov Stanislav IP-34

A simple, static frontend project built as part of Frontend Basics coursework.

### Project Description

This project delivers a small web page using only HTML and CSS to practice layout, typography, and responsive styling fundamentals. It is intentionally lightweight and framework-free so you can focus on core web platform skills.

### Features

- **Semantic HTML**: Clean structure in `index.html` for accessibility and maintainability
- **Custom Styles**: Centralized styles in `styles.css`

### Project Structure

```
.
├── index.html   # Main page markup
├── styles.css   # Global styles for the page
└── README.md    # Project documentation
```

### How to Run Locally

No installation is required. Simply open the HTML file in your browser:

1. Locate the project folder
2. Open `index.html` with any modern browser:
   - Double‑click `index.html`, or
   - Right‑click → Open With → your browser of choice

### Usage

- Open the page and review the layout and styles
- Resize your browser window to see responsive behavior

### Development Notes

- Built with plain HTML and CSS; no frameworks or bundlers
- Validate your HTML/CSS for best practices and accessibility

### Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers:
- Chrome (latest)
- Firefox (latest)
- Edge (latest)
- Safari (latest)

### Troubleshooting

- **Styles not loading**: Ensure `styles.css` is in the same directory as `index.html` and that the `<link>` path in `index.html` is correct
- **Caching issues**: Hard refresh the page (Ctrl+F5 on Windows, Cmd+Shift+R on macOS)
- **Local server issues**: If using a server, confirm you opened the correct folder and URL
